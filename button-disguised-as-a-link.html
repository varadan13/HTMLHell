Issues and how to fix them

Wrong usage of the button element. There’s an element for linking to external sites (<a>). Do not change native semantics, unless you really have to.

It’s possible to link to pages without JavaScript.

The title attribute is redundant.

The tabindex attribute is redundant. A button doesn’t need tabindex, it’s focusable by default.
