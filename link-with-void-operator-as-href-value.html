Issues and how to fix them

Links won't work, if JavaScript fails to load or execute.

You donâ€™t need JavaScript to link to other pages, you can use the href attribute for that. Browser support is pretty good (100% of all browsers).

The context menu on right click is different, "Open in new tab/window" is not available.

CMD + Click to open a link in the background won't work.
